BARIDIMOB_CANCEL_URL="http://localhost:3000/payment/cancel"
```

## Development/Testing Setup

For development and testing purposes, you can use these configurations:

### Testing Without Real API Keys

1. **Daily.co**: The platform will work without video calling if no API key is provided
2. **Cloudinary**: File uploads will fail gracefully - you can test other features
3. **Baridimob**: Payment simulation is already implemented for testing

### Demo Configuration

For immediate testing, you can leave the API keys as placeholder values. The platform has built-in error handling and will show appropriate messages when services are unavailable.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Copy the .env template**:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. **Edit the .env file**:
   ```bash
   nano backend/.env
   ```

3. **Replace placeholder values with your actual API keys**

4. **Restart the backend**:
   ```bash
   sudo supervisorctl restart backend
   ```

5. **Verify configuration**:
   - Check backend logs: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log`
   - Test video calling from the dashboard
   - Try uploading a document
   - Attempt a payment flow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Video calling not working**:
   - Verify DAILY_API_KEY is correct
   - Check Daily.co dashboard for API usage
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded free tier limits

2. **File uploads failing**:
   - Verify all three Cloudinary credentials are correct
   - Check Cloudinary dashboard for usage stats
   - Ensure file types and sizes are within limits

3. **Payment issues**:
   - For development, use the simulation endpoints
   - For production, verify Baridimob merchant account status
   - Check return/cancel URLs are accessible

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor API usage to detect unauthorized access
- Use different keys for development and production environments

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Use a secure secret management service
2. Set up proper SSL certificates
3. Configure proper CORS origins
4. Set up monitoring and alerting for API usage
5. Implement proper backup strategies for uploaded documents
